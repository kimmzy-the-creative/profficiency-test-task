Initial Feedback and changes to be made:
1.Please use "Inter" as font. You can find it in google fonts and embed in the head part.
2.The nav bar (Introduction, For Carers, For Care Organizations, etc) has to stick at the top when it "touches" the top on scroll.
3.In "The Product", Feature 1, Feature 2 are "tabs". You can use dummy contents for now just to demonstrate
4.I think you missed the "For Carers and Carer Organizations" section?
5.As for the first panel, I have included the image in the assets folder :slightly_smiling_face:
